The first player throws a dice and every number (except number 1) he gets is kept until he clicks `Hold` and then the score is kept for his total and the turn goes to the second player.<br>
But if the player does not press `Hold` and gets the number 1 in the dice then all the score he collected Before he has time to reach the total, i.e, pressing `Hold` is simply deleted and the turn passes to the next player.<br><br>
